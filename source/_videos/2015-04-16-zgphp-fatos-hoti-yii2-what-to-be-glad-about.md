Since Yii2 was released at the end of 2014 there was plenty of time for Fatos Hoti to get to know its dirty little secrets. Together, we will investigate what is new, what is better, what is worse and how to use it all in the real world.<br />

Fatos is developer for over 10 years now, currently employed at Degordian. He loves code and everything about it.

This talk is manly intended for people who worked with yii1 and didn't have the time to look into what's new in version 2
